        "The financial market is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that generates vast amounts of data every second, including stock prices, news updates, industry trends, and economic reports. Analyzing this data is critical for investors and analysts to make informed decisions and manage risks. Traditionally, market data analysis has relied on manual efforts or basic tools that extract and process data from individual sources. This approach, while effective to some extent, is time-consuming, prone to errors, and limited in uncovering deeper insights such as hidden patterns or relationships between entities like companies, sectors, and stocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generative AI (Gen AI) offers transformative potential in market data analysis by automating data extraction, processing, and structuring. With its ability to process unstructured data, Gen AI can uncover complex relationships and provide real-time, actionable insights. By combining web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge graph construction, AI systems can not only handle the scale and speed required in financial markets but also offer personalized, context-aware insights to users. This allows professionals to quickly navigate the overwhelming sea of market data and focus on strategic decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this project, we leverage the capabilities of Gen AI to create a Knowledge Graph RAG system for market sentiment data analysis. Using web scraping techniques, we gather real-time data from multiple sources such as stock feeds, financial news websites, and industry reports. This structured information is used to build a knowledge graph database with Neo4j, LlamaIndex and OpenAI. We then query the graph index  for generating context-aware responses to user queries.**\n"

        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced natural language processing framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. The approach enhances the ability of language models to generate accurate, contextually relevant, and factual responses by integrating external knowledge retrieved from a database or document store.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How RAG Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Query**: A user provides a query or question.\n",
        "2. **Retrieval Phase**:\n",
        "   - The query is passed to a retriever model that searches for relevant documents or knowledge snippets from a pre-built database or vector store.\n",
        "   - These documents are ranked based on their relevance to the query using similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).\n",
        "3. **Augmentation Phase**:\n",
        "   - The retrieved documents are appended to the query to create an augmented input.\n",
        "   - This augmented input is passed to a generation model, typically a large language model (LLM).\n",
        "4. **Generation Phase**:\n",
        "   - The generation model processes the augmented input to create a coherent and context-aware response.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Factual Accuracy**: By retrieving real-time, context-relevant information, RAG reduces hallucinations (made-up information) in LLM outputs.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: RAG systems can scale with growing knowledge bases by integrating vector databases such as FAISS, Pinecone, or Milvus.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Retrieval and generation components can be updated independently, allowing for easier customization and improvements.\n",

        "\n",
        "GraphRAG builds upon the principles of RAG by incorporating **graph-based representations** for enhanced contextual understanding. In scenarios where relationships between entities, concepts, or events are critical, GraphRAG uses knowledge graphs to represent and leverage these connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is GraphRAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "GraphRAG integrates **knowledge graphs** with RAG's retrieval and generation framework. Knowledge graphs store information as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). These graphs provide structured, interconnected data that enrich the retrieval and generation processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How GraphRAG Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Query**:\n",
        "   - The query is processed to identify key entities and relationships.\n",
        "2. **Graph-Based Retrieval**:\n",
        "   - Instead of or in addition to using a standard vector database, GraphRAG queries the knowledge graph for related entities and their connections.\n",
        "   - Relevant subgraphs are extracted and converted into a textual or structured format suitable for augmentation.\n",
        "3. **Augmentation**:\n",
        "   - The extracted graph-based context is combined with the query, similar to RAG.\n",
        "4. **Generation**:\n",
        "   - A generation model processes the augmented input to create a response that incorporates the relational and contextual information from the graph.\n",
        "5. **Feedback Loop**:\n",
        "   - User feedback and new data can be used to update the knowledge graph, ensuring continuous improvement and relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of GraphRAG\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Relational Context**: By using knowledge graphs, GraphRAG captures relationships between entities, providing deeper insights into complex queries.\n",
        "- **Dynamic Updates**: Knowledge graphs can be updated in real-time, ensuring that the retrieval process remains relevant.\n",
        "- **Domain-Specific Applications**: GraphRAG is particularly effective in domains like healthcare, finance, and supply chain, where interconnected data plays a significant role.\n",

        "## Applications of GraphRAG\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Healthcare**:\n",
        "   - Building systems that understand patient histories and medical relationships (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments).\n",
        "2. **Customer Support**:\n",
        "   - Context-aware chatbots that use customer interaction graphs to provide personalized support.\n",
        "3. **Supply Chain Management**:\n",
        "   - Optimizing logistics by understanding relationships between suppliers, products, and delivery routes.\n",

            "\n",
            "The automotive industry faces crucial financial risks fundamentally linked to potential modifications or terminations in state incentives, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit. Such adjustments could have a tangible impact on electric vehicle sales and respective pricing strategies. Further, variations in regulatory credits, production expenses, and the average selling prices (ASP) of vehicles are also potential sources of financial risk on the performance of automotive companies. \n",

            "3. Factors Driving the Sentiments:\n",
            "\n",
            "The sentiments stem from the potential shifts in policy and market dynamics. Policies such as tax incentives strongly influence EV sales, while manufacturing costs and average selling prices directly affect a company's profitability. Regulatory credit fluctuations add a layer of uncertainty, influencing both business strategies and investor confidence.\n",

Keeping an eye on market trends in manufacturing costs and selling prices is also crucial for positioning. To mitigate potential negative effects, consider diversifying investments across different segments of the automotive industry or hedging with investments in other sectors.\n",
