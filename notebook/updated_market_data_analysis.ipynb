            "\n",
            "The automotive industry faces crucial financial risks fundamentally linked to potential modifications or terminations in state incentives, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit. Such adjustments could have a tangible impact on electric vehicle sales and respective pricing strategies. Further, variations in regulatory credits, production expenses, and the average selling prices (ASP) of vehicles are also potential sources of financial risk on the performance of automotive companies. \n",

            "3. Factors Driving the Sentiments:\n",
            "\n",
            "The sentiments stem from the potential shifts in policy and market dynamics. Policies such as tax incentives strongly influence EV sales, while manufacturing costs and average selling prices directly affect a company's profitability. Regulatory credit fluctuations add a layer of uncertainty, influencing both business strategies and investor confidence.\n",

Keeping an eye on market trends in manufacturing costs and selling prices is also crucial for positioning. To mitigate potential negative effects, consider diversifying investments across different segments of the automotive industry or hedging with investments in other sectors.\n",

        "This project successfully demonstrates the power of combining graph-based knowledge representation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable effective financial sentiment analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as LlamaIndex, Neo4j, and OpenAI embeddings, the system efficiently organizes and retrieves data from unstructured sources, transforming it into actionable insights. The integration of knowledge graphs allows for a rich understanding of relationships between entities, while the use of LLMs enhances contextual accuracy in query responses."
