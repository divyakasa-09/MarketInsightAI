# MarketInsightAI
Its a real-time financial analysis system that scrapes the web for the latest market data, processes it, and builds a knowledge graph using Neo4j to map relationships between financial entities like companies, sectors, and trends.  It then uses RAG to answer user-specific queries with context-aware insights based on current financial landscape.
